# ICE2025 - Developer Community Platform

A modern developer community platform built with Nuxt.js and Tailwind CSS - completely vibe-coded with GitHub Copilot in a few coding sessions!

## 🎯 Why This Exists

This project started as a fun experiment - "let's try something quick" - and went on a beautiful tangent that resulted in a full-featured community platform. It's a testament to what we can accomplish with modern AI-assisted development and vibe coding. What started as curiosity became a complete application with user management, real-time features, and a polished UI.

**The entire development cost? Just $11/year for the domain from Namecheap.com** 🤯

## 💡 Top 10 Prompts That Built This Platform

Here are the key prompts that shaped this project (in roughly chronological order):

1. **"Create a modern developer community platform with user profiles and skills"**
   - Generated the initial project structure and basic user management

2. **"Add a skill rating system where users can rate themselves 1-5 stars on technical skills"**
   - Implemented the star-based skill proficiency system with database storage

3. **"Create a real-time messaging system between users"**
   - Built the chat functionality with message persistence

4. **"Add team creation and management features"**
   - Developed the team system with member management

5. **"Implement image upload with Google Drive integration for larger files"**
   - Created hybrid storage: local uploads + Google Drive proxy for large media

6. **"Add mentor badges and special roles for experienced developers"**
   - Introduced the mentor system with visual badges and special permissions

7. **"Create a responsive profile page with all user information and social links"**
   - Built comprehensive profile displays with contact information and portfolios

8. **"Fix the user links not saving properly - they save to database but don't load in edit page"**
   - Debugged and fixed data persistence issues in the profile editing system

9. **"Make bio text display line breaks properly - database has \n but HTML shows one paragraph"**
   - Implemented proper text formatting with CSS `whitespace-pre-line`

10. **"Skill levels show random stars instead of saved values - implement proper database storage"**
    - Fixed skill level persistence to show actual user-rated proficiency levels

## 🏗️ Image & Media Storage System

### Overview
ICE2025 uses a hybrid media storage approach optimized for cost and performance:

- **Profile Images**: Uploaded to Vercel Blob Storage for reliability
- **Large Media**: Google Drive integration with server-side proxy for videos
- **Static Assets**: Served directly by Vercel's CDN
- **Zero Storage Costs**: Leveraging free tiers and existing Google Drive storage

### Architecture Benefits
- **Performance**: CDN-cached images with optimized delivery
- **Cost Effective**: No additional storage fees beyond domain registration
- **Scalability**: Vercel handles traffic spikes automatically
- **Reliability**: Multiple storage backends for redundancy

### Media Handling Flow

1. **Small Images** (< 5MB): Direct upload to Vercel Blob Storage
2. **Large Media**: Users share Google Drive links, proxied through our API
3. **Processing**: Automatic format detection and validation
4. **Serving**: Optimized delivery through Vercel's edge network

### Database Schema (Supabase)

Generated entirely through Copilot-assisted prompts, the database includes:

```sql
-- Core tables created via Copilot schema generation
CREATE TABLE users (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    skills JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,  -- Stores skill objects with levels
    user_links TEXT,                   -- JSON string of social links
    role TEXT DEFAULT 'user',
    -- ... other profile fields
);

CREATE TABLE messages (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    "senderId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "receiverId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE teams (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    members TEXT[] DEFAULT '{}',
    "creatorId" TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

### File Organization

```
Vercel Blob Storage:
├── user-profiles/
│   ├── {uuid}-profile.jpg
│   └── {uuid}-profile.webp

Google Drive Integration:
├── /api/proxy-image?id={drive-file-id}  # Proxied images
└── /api/proxy-video?id={drive-file-id}  # Proxied videos
```
